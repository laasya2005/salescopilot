We've also had some unexpected billing increases over the past few months.\nRep:\nThat's helpful. How many active lines are we talking about?\nBuyer:\nAbout 48 mobile lines and 12 data-only SIMs for tablets.\nRep:\nGot it. Are the coverage issues impacting daily operations?\nBuyer:\nYes, especially when teams can't upload reports from job sites. It delays invoicing and sometimes affects customer satisfaction.\nRep:\nUnderstood. Have you allocated a budget range for switching providers?\nBuyer:\nWe're currently spending around $6,500 per month. If we can improve coverage and maintain similar costs, that would make sense for us.\nRep:\nAnd who would be involved in approving a change?\nBuyer:\nI'll handle the technical evaluation, but our Director of Operations will approve the final decision.\nRep:\nAre you speaking with other providers?\nBuyer:\nYes, we've had an initial conversation with AT&T as well.\nRep:\nWhat timeline are you working toward?\nBuyer:\nOur contracts expire in about 75 days, so we'd like to make a decision within the next month.\nRep:\nThat makes sense. Would it be helpful to review a side-by-side coverage comparison and pricing breakdown with your Director next week?\nBuyer:\nYes, that would be ideal.

He's the final sign-off on tools over\n  $50K/year.\n\n  Also — heads up, we're also evaluating Databricks and have a demo with them next Tuesday. I want to make sure we're comparing apples\n  to apples before our Q2 budget review on March 15.\n\n  Best,\n  Sarah Chen\n  VP of Data Engineering | Technovate\n\n  ---\n\n  From: you@yourcompany.com\n  To: sarah.chen@technovate.io\n  Subject: Re: Re: Following up on your data platform needs\n  Date: Feb 18, 2026\n\n  Hi Sarah,\n\n  Great speaking with you yesterday! As promised, I'm attaching the Meridian Corp case study — they had a very similar Snowflake\n  migration and saw 40% cost reduction within 6 months.\n\n  I'd love to set up a technical deep-dive with your engineering team. Would next week work?\n\n  Best,\n  Alex\n\n  ---\n\n  From: sarah.chen@technovate.io\n  To: you@yourcompany.com\n  Subject: Re: Following up on your data platform needs\n  Date: Feb 14, 2026\n\n  Hi Alex,\n\n  Sorry for the delayed reply — it's been a hectic sprint. Yes, I'd be open to a quick 20-min call to discuss. We're definitely feeling\n   the pain with our current setup — query times are through the roof and we're spending way too much on compute.\n\n  That said, I should be upfront: we don't have a huge budget right now. Our CFO has been tightening things up, so anything over\n  $80K/year would be a tough sell without very clear ROI numbers.\n\n  Can you send over any case studies from companies in our space (B2B SaaS, 200-500 employees)?\n\n  Thanks,\n  Sarah\n\n  ---\n\n  From: you@yourcompany.com\n  To: sarah.chen@technovate.io\n  Subject: Following up on your data platform needs\n  Date: Feb 10, 2026\n\n  Hi Sarah,\n\n  I came across Technovate's recent Series C announcement — congrats! As you scale your data team, I wanted to reach out about how our\n  platform has helped similar B2B SaaS companies cut data infrastructure costs by 30-50% while improving query performance.\n\n  Would you be open to a brief call next week to see if there's a fit?\n\n  Best regards,\n  Alex Rivera\n  Account Executive",
